NAME
    Unicode::LineBreak - UAX #14 Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::LineBreak;
        $lb = Unicode::LineBreak->new($string);
        $string = $lb->break;

DESCRIPTION
    Unicode::LineBreak performs Line Breaking Algorithm described in Unicode
    Standards Annex #14 [UAX #14]. East_Asian_Width informative properties
    [UAX #11] will be concerned to determin breaking positions.

    NOTE: Current release of this module is pre-alpha just for
    proof-of-concept.

  Public Interface
    new STRING, [OPTIONS, ...]
        Constructor. Following OPTIONS may be specified.

        Breaking => METHOD
            *Not yet implemented*. Specify the method to format broken
            lines.

            "DEFAULT"
                Default method. Insert newline at arbitrary breaking
                positions.

            "NEWLINE"
                Remove SPACEs leading newline sequences, and append newline
                at end of text if it does not exist.

            "TRIM"
                Remove SPACEs leading newline sequences.

            Subroutine reference
                See "Costomizing Line Breaking Behavior".

            See also Newline option.

        Charset => CHARSET
            Character set that is used to encode string STRING. Default is
            "UTF-8".

        Context => CONTEXT
            Along with Charset option, this may be used to define
            language/region context. Currently available contexts are
            "EASTASIAN" and "NONEASTASIAN". Default context is
            "NONEASTASIAN".

        HangulAsAL => "YES" | "NO"
            Treat hangul syllables and conjoining jamos as alphabetic
            characters (AL). Default is "NO".

        Language => LANGUAGE
            Along with Charset option, this may be used to define
            language/region context. See Context option.

        LegacyCM => "YES" | "NO"
            Treat combining characters lead by SPACE as an isolated
            combining character. As of Unicode 5.0, such use of SPACE is not
            recommended. Default is "YES".

        MaxColumns => NUMBER
            Maximum number of columns line may include not counting trailing
            spaces and newline sequence. In other words, maximum length of
            line. Default is 76.

        Newline => STRING
            *Not yet implemented*. Replace newline sequences with Unicode
            string STRING. If "undef" is specified, newline sequences will
            not be modified. Default is "undef".

        NSKanaAsID => "YES" | "NO"
            Treat hiragana/katakana small letters and prolonged signs (NS)
            as ideographic characters (ID). This feature is optional in [JIS
            X 4051]. Default is "NO".

        OutputCharset => CHARSET
            Character set that is used to encode result of break(). If a
            special value "_UNICODE_" is specified, result will be Unicode
            string. Default is "UTF-8".

    break
        Instance method. Break string and returns it.

  Customizing Line Breaking Behavior
    If you specify subroutine reference as a value of Breaking option, it
    should accept three arguments: Instance of LineBreak object, ACTION and
    STRING. ACTION is a string to determine the context that subroutine is
    called in. STRING is a fragment of text leading or trailing breaking
    position.

        ACTION| When Fired            | Value of STRING
        ------+-----------------------+---------------------------------
        "sot" | Beginning of text     | Fragment of first line
        "sop" | After mandatory break | Fragment of next line
        "sol" | After arbitrary break | Fragment at sequel of line
        "eol" | Arabitrary break      | Leading SPACEs at breaking position
        "eop" | Mandatory break       | Leading SPACEs and newline
        "eot" | End of text           | Leading SPACEs (and newline)
        ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Subroutine should return modified text fragment or may return "undef" to
    express that no modification occurred. Note that modification in the
    context of "sot", "sop" or "sol" may affect decision of successive
    breaking positions while in the others won't.

    Following table describes built-in behavior by Breaking options.

              | "DEFAULT"       | "TRIM"            | "NEWLINE"
        ------+-----------------+-------------------+-------------------
        "sot" | do nothing      | do nothing        | do nothing
        "sop" | do nothing      | do nothing        | do nothing
        "sol" | do nothing      | do nothing        | do nothing
        "eol" | append newline  | replace by newline| replace by newline
        "eop" | do nothing      | replace by newline| replace by newline
        "eot" | do nothing      | remove SPACEs     | replace by newline
        ----------------------------------------------------------------

  Configuration Files
    Built-in defaults of option parameters for "new" method can be
    overridden by configuration files: MIME/Charset/Defaults.pm and
    Unicode/LineBreak/Defaults.pm. For more details read
    Unicode/LineBreak/Defaults.pm.sample.

  Conformance to Standards
    Character properties based on by this module are defined by Unicode
    Standards version 5.1.0.

    This module is intended to implement UAX14-C2.

    *   Hiragana/katakana small letters and prolonged signs may be treated
        as either NS or ID by choice (See [JIS X 4051] 6.1.1).

    *   Hangul syllables and conjoining jamos may be treated as either
        H2/H3/JL/JT/JV or AL by choice.

    *   Characters assigned to AI may be resolved to either AL or ID by
        choice.

    *   Character(s) assigned to CB are not resolved.

    *   Characters assigned to SA are resolved to AL, except that characters
        that have General_Category Mn or Mc be resolved to CM.

    *   Characters assigned to SG or XX are resolved to AL.

CAVEAT
    *To be written*.
