NAME
    Unicode::LineBreak - UAX #14 Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::LineBreak;
        $lb = Unicode::LineBreak->new($string);
        $string = $lb->break;

DESCRIPTION
    Unicode::LineBreak performs Line Breaking Algorithm described in Unicode
    Standards Annex #14 [UAX #14]. East_Asian_Width informative properties
    [UAX #11] will be concerned to determin breaking points.

PUBLIC INTERFACE
    new [STRING, [OPTIONS...]]
        DeScRiPtIoNs...

    config [OPTIONS...]

        Charset => CHARSET
        Context => "EASTASIAN" | "NONEASTASIAN"
        Language => LANGUAGE
            DeScRiPtIoNs...

        HangulAsAL => "YES" | "NO"
            Treat hangul syllables and conjoining jamos as AL.

        MaxColumns => NUMBER
            DeScRiPtIoNs...

        NSKanaAsID => "YES" | "NO"
            Treat hiragana/katakana non-starters and prolonged signs (NS) as
            ID. This feature is optional in [JIS X 4051].

        OutputCharset => CHARSET
            DeScRiPtIoNs...

    break
        DeScRiPtIoNs...

  Configuration Files
    Built-in defaults of option parameters for "new" and "config" can be
    overridden by configuration files: MIME/Charset/Defaults.pm and
    Unicode/LineBreak/Defaults.pm. For more details read
    Unicode/LineBreak/Defaults.pm.sample.

  Conformance to Standards
    Character properties based on by this module are defined by Unicode
    Standards version 5.1.0.

    This module implements UAX14-C2.

    *   Hiragana/katakana small letters and prolonged signs may be treated
        as either NS or ID by choice (See [JIS X 4051] 6.1.1).

    *   Hangul syllables and conjoining jamos may be treated as either
        H2/H3/JL/JT/JV or AL by choice.

    *   Characters assigned to AI may be resolved to either AL or ID by
        choice.

    *   Character(s) assigned to CB are not resolved.

    *   Characters assigned to SA are resolved to AL, except that characters
        that have General_Category Mn or Mc be resolved to CM.

    *   Characters assigned to SG or XX are resolved to AL.

BUGS
    Slightly slow. XS implementation might be required.
